## Environment Variables to Update

```bash
# Required for production
NODE_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-secret"
BASE_URL="https://your-domain.com"
FRONTEND_URL="https://your-frontend-domain.com"

# OAuth providers
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="your-github-id"
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="your-github-secret"
GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL="https://your-domain.com/api/auth/github/callback"

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-secret"
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL="https://your-domain.com/api/auth/google/callback"

# Email configuration
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-app-password"
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@your-domain.com"
```

## Quick Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Upload and run deployment script
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh

# 2. Configure environment
nano .env

# 3. Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Start application
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

# 5. Setup SSL (optional)
chmod +x setup-ssl.sh
./setup-ssl.sh
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check application status
pm2 status
pm2 logs linkmanager-api

# Check Nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo nginx -t

# Check database connection
npx prisma db pull

# Test API endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/
curl https://your-domain.com/api-docs
```

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

```bash
# Stop PM2 application
pm2 stop linkmanager-api

# Restore previous version (if applicable)
git checkout previous-working-commit
npm run build
pm2 restart linkmanager-api

# Or start in development mode for debugging
npm run dev
```

## Post-Deployment Tasks

- [ ] Update OAuth applications with production URLs
- [ ] Test all functionality end-to-end
- [ ] Monitor logs for first 24 hours
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Document any custom configurations
- [ ] Share production URLs with team
